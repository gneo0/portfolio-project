        My journey into full-stack development began with a project for my
        family&apos;s business, sparking a passion for coding. Now, I build dynamic,
        user-friendly applications that solve real problems and bring ideas to
        life. I&apos;m always passionate about learning new technologies &
        contributing to open-source.
